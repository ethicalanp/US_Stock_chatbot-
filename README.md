# US_Stock_chatbot-
This project is a simple stock market chatbot that allows users to fetch the latest stock prices using two interfaces: a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and a RESTful API accessed via Postman.


GUI: A user-friendly interface that allows users to input stock symbols and receive real-time stock prices.
API Access: Use Postman to send requests to the chatbot's API for retrieving stock prices.
